I'm a full-stack developer based in Antwerp, captivated by technology and problem-solving. My experience spans across various software technologies including React, Node.js, Rails, Ruby, Postgres, GraphQL, and Elixir.

I'm a versatile developer who quickly adapts to new technology and effectively applies it in production. My projects range from building full-stack applications to cross-compiling Android for ARM Point of Sales devices. At PlayPass, I developed access control software for festivals like Rock Werchter, and large venues such as Sportpaleis. At November Five, my focus shifted towards frontend technologies, and I became an advocate for Serverless architecture. Using React, we transform designs into interactive frontend applications powered by Serverless backend for frontends (BFF).

In my free time, I enjoy culinary classes at Piva and swimming. As a typical Belgian Burgundian, I appreciate good food paired with a glass of wine. My personality can be described as straightforward with a dash of sarcasm.
