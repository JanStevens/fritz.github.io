Robot localization needs to be solved in order to use the robot for other purposes. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of DASH7 tags, operating on the 433 MHz unlicensed band, for locating mobile robots in domestic environments. We achieve the same level of accuracy as laser range finder based localization, while using less processing power. Our results indicate that DASH7 can be used for robot localization, solving the robot localization problem.
