We leave our clients with more than products. By building meaningful relations throughout their organisation, we transform them from within and ensure we live and breathe digital together.

As a frontend React developer I transform the designs to a fully functional application. I think critical about how components should hook together and keep them easy to understand. Recently my focus shift to become a Full stack developer leveraging AWS and serverless.
