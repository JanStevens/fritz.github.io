PlayPass is a rapidly growing startup that develops software for festival organizers and large venues. The firm offers solutions for Access Control, Accreditation, and Cashless Payments.

In my role, I primarily handled the architecture and development of these solutions, focusing primarily on Access Control and Accreditation. As the lead developer, I mentored other developers and outlined the future vision for the software. I also played an active role in daily development activities.
