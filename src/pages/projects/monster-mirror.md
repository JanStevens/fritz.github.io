Monster Mirror enhances your Gloomhaven boardgame journey by providing a convenient way to view monster ability cards. Designed as a companion app, it seamlessly integrates with the physical monster ability cards rather than serving as a replacement. This ensures a streamlined and complementary experience, preserving the tactile engagement of the original game components.
