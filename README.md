Hello :wave:, welcome to my [personal website](https://janstevens.dev) soure code!

This website runs on Github and uses a free cloudflare account (for SSL and caching) in front of it. Using Astro a statical HTML version is created from this source code and deployed automatically with github actions to github pages.

## Credits

This website wouldn't be possible without the following projects:

- Astro (https://astro.build/)
- Astro-CV-Esquelete (https://github.com/mmouzo/astro-cv-esquelete)
